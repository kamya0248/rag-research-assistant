Does an artificial intelligence perform market manipulation with its own discretion? -- A genetic algorithm learns in an artificial market simulation,Takanobu Mizuta,"Who should be charged with responsibility for an artificial intelligence
performing market manipulation have been discussed. In this study, I
constructed an artificial intelligence using a genetic algorithm that learns in
an artificial market simulation, and investigated whether the artificial
intelligence discovers market manipulation through learning with an artificial
market simulation despite a builder of artificial intelligence has no intention
of market manipulation. As a result, the artificial intelligence discovered
market manipulation as an optimal investment strategy. This result suggests
necessity of regulation, such as obligating builders of artificial intelligence
to prevent artificial intelligence from performing market manipulation.",2020-05-21,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10488v1,Artificial Intelligence

A framework for understanding data science,Michael L Brodie,"The objective of this research is to provide a framework with which the data
science community can understand, define, and develop data science as a field
of inquiry. The framework is based on the classical reference framework
(axiology, ontology, epistemology, methodology) used for 200 years to define
knowledge discovery paradigms and disciplines in the humanities, sciences,
algorithms, and now data science. I augmented it for automated problem-solving
with (methods, technology, community). The resulting data science reference
framework is used to define the data science knowledge discovery paradigm in
terms of the philosophy of data science addressed in previous papers and the
data science problem-solving paradigm, i.e., the data science method, and the
data science problem-solving workflow, both addressed in this paper. The
framework is a much called for unifying framework for data science as it
contains the components required to define data science. For insights to better
understand data science, this paper uses the framework to define the emerging,
often enigmatic, data science problem-solving paradigm and workflow, and to
compare them with their well-understood scientific counterparts, scientific
problem-solving paradigm and workflow.",2024-02-14,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00776v1,Data Science

Data Science in Perspective,Rogerio Rossi,"Data and Science has stood out in the generation of results, whether in the
projects of the scientific domain or business domain. CERN Project, Scientific
Institutes, companies like Walmart, Google, Apple, among others, need data to
present their results and make predictions in the competitive data world. Data
and Science are words that together culminated in a globally recognized term
called Data Science. Data Science is in its initial phase, possibly being part
of formal sciences and also being presented as part of applied sciences,
capable of generating value and supporting decision making. Data Science
considers science and, consequently, the scientific method to promote decision
making through data intelligence. In many cases, the application of the method
(or part of it) is considered in Data Science projects in scientific domain
(social sciences, bioinformatics, geospatial projects) or business domain
(finance, logistic, retail), among others. In this sense, this article
addresses the perspectives of Data Science as a multidisciplinary area,
considering science and the scientific method, and its formal structure which
integrate Statistics, Computer Science, and Business Science, also taking into
account Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing Machine Learning, among others.
The article also deals with the perspective of applied Data Science, since Data
Science is used for generating value through scientific and business projects.

Data Science: A Comprehensive Overview,Longbing Cao,"The twenty-first century has ushered in the age of big data and data economy,
in which data DNA, which carries important knowledge, insights and potential,
has become an intrinsic constituent of all data-based organisms. An appropriate
understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new field of data
science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big
data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase,
significant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by
the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science.
This paper provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental
aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the
data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major
challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new
industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession

A Systematic Literature Review of Undergraduate Data Science Education Research,"Mine Dogucu, Sinem Demirci, Harry Bendekgey, Federica Zoe Ricci, Catalina M. Medina","The presence of data science has been profound in the scientific community in
almost every discipline. An important part of the data science education
expansion has been at the undergraduate level. We conducted a systematic
literature review to (1) portray current evidence and knowledge gaps in
self-proclaimed undergraduate data science education research and (2) inform
policymakers and the data science education community about what educators may
encounter when searching for literature using the general keyword 'data science
education.' While open-access publications that target a broader audience of
data science educators and include multiple examples of data science programs
and courses are a strength, significant knowledge gaps remain. The
undergraduate data science literature that we identified often lacks empirical
data, research questions and reproducibility. Certain disciplines are less

Defining data science: a new field of inquiry,Michael L Brodie,"Data science is not a science. It is a research paradigm. Its power, scope,
and scale will surpass science, our most powerful research paradigm, to enable
knowledge discovery and change our world. We have yet to understand and define
it, vital to realizing its potential and managing its risks. Modern data
science is in its infancy. Emerging slowly since 1962 and rapidly since 2000,
it is a fundamentally new field of inquiry, one of the most active, powerful,
and rapidly evolving 21st century innovations. Due to its value, power, and
applicability, it is emerging in over 40 disciplines, hundreds of research
areas, and thousands of applications. Millions of data science publications
contain myriad definitions of data science and data science problem solving.
Due to its infancy, many definitions are independent, application specific,
mutually incomplete, redundant, or inconsistent, hence so is data science. This
research addresses this data science multiple definitions challenge by
proposing the development of coherent, unified definition based on a data
science reference framework using a data science journal for the data science
community to achieve such a definition. This paper provides candidate
definitions for essential data science artifacts that are required to discuss
such a definition. They are based on the classical research paradigm concept
consisting of a philosophy of data science, the data science problem solving
paradigm, and the six component data science reference framework (axiology,
ontology, epistemology, methodology, methods, technology) that is a frequently
called for unifying framework with which to define, unify, and evolve data
science. It presents challenges for defining data science, solution approaches,

Three Laws of Technology Rise or Fall,Jianfeng Zhan,"Newton's laws of motion perfectly explain or approximate physical phenomena
in our everyday life. Are there any laws that explain or approximate
technology's rise or fall? After reviewing thirteen information technologies
that succeeded, this article concludes three laws of technology and derives
five corollaries to explain or approximate the rise or fall of technology.
Three laws are the laws of technology inertia, technology change force, and
technology action and reaction. Five corollaries are the corollaries of
measurement of technology change force, technology breakthrough, technology
monopoly, technology openness, and technology business opportunity. I present
how to use the laws and the corollaries to analyze an emerging technology --
the open-source RISC-V processor. Also, I elaborate on benchmarks' role in
applying those laws.",2022-04-07,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03241v1,Technology
A New Classification of Technologies,Mario Coccia,"This study here suggests a classification of technologies based on taxonomic
characteristics of interaction between technologies in complex systems that is
not a studied research field in economics of technical change. The proposed
taxonomy here categorizes technologies in four typologies, in a broad analogy
with the ecology: 1) technological parasitism is a relationship between two
technologies T1 and T2 in a complex system S where one technology T1 benefits
from the interaction with T2, whereas T2 has a negative side from interaction
with T1; 2) technological commensalism is a relationship between two
technologies in S where one technology benefits from the other without
affecting it; 3) technological mutualism is a relationship in which each
technology benefits from the activity of the other within complex systems; 4)
technological symbiosis is a long-term interaction between two (or more)
technologies that evolve together in complex systems. This taxonomy
systematizes the typologies of interactive technologies within complex systems
and predicts their evolutionary pathways that generate stepwise coevolutionary
processes of complex systems of technology. This study here begins the process
of generalizing, as far as possible, critical typologies of interactive
technologies that explain the long-run evolution of technology. The theoretical
framework developed here opens the black box of the interaction between
technologies that affects, with different types of technologies, the
evolutionary pathways of complex systems of technology over time and space.
Overall, then, this new theoretical framework may be useful for bringing a new
perspective to categorize the gradient of benefit to technologies from
interaction with other technologies that can be a ground work for development
of more sophisticated concepts to clarify technological and economic change in
human society.",2017-12-11,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07711v1,Technology
Technological Parasitism,Mario Coccia,"Technological parasitism is a new theory to explain the evolution of
technology in society. In this context, this study proposes a model to analyze
the interaction between a host technology (system) and a parasitic technology
(subsystem) to explain evolutionary pathways of technologies as complex
systems. The coefficient of evolutionary growth of the model here indicates the
typology of evolution of parasitic technology in relation to host technology:
i.e., underdevelopment, growth and development. This approach is illustrated
with realistic examples using empirical data of product and process
technologies. Overall, then, the theory of technological parasitism can be
useful for bringing a new perspective to explain and generalize the evolution
of technology and predict which innovations are likely to evolve rapidly in
society.",2019-01-25,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09073v1,Technology
Measurement of the evolution of technology: A new perspective,Mario Coccia,"A fundamental problem in technological studies is how to measure the
evolution of technology. The literature has suggested several approaches to
measuring the level of technology (or state-of-the-art) and changes in
technology. However, the measurement of technological advances and
technological evolution is often a complex and elusive topic in science. The
study here starts by establishing a conceptual framework of technological
evolution based on the theory of technological parasitism, in broad analogy
with biology. Then, the measurement of the evolution of technology is modelled
in terms of morphological changes within complex systems considering the
interaction between a host technology and its subsystems of technology. The
coefficient of evolutionary growth of the model here indicates the grade and
type of the evolutionary route of a technology. This coefficient is quantified
in real instances using historical data of farm tractor, freight locomotive and
electricity generation technology in steam-powered plants and
internal-combustion plants. Overall, then, it seems that the approach here is
appropriate in grasping the typology of evolution of complex systems of
technology and in predicting which technologies are likeliest to evolve
rapidly.",2018-03-23,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08698v1,Technology

Cellular automata for the spreading of technologies in socio-economic systems,"Ferenc Kun, Gergely Kocsis, Janos Farkas","We introduce an agent-based model for the spreading of technological
developments in socio-economic systems where the technology is mainly used for
the collaboration/interaction of agents. Agents use products of different
technologies to collaborate with each other which induce costs proportional to
the difference of technological levels. Additional costs arise when
technologies of different providers are used. Agents can adopt technologies and
providers of their interacting partners in order to reduce their costs leading
to microscopic rearrangements of the system. Analytical calculations and
computer simulations revealed that starting from a random configuration of
different technological levels a complex time evolution emerges where the
spreading of advanced technologies and the overall technological progress of
the system are determined by the amount of advantages more advanced
technologies provide, and by the structure of the social environment of agents.
We show that agents tend to form clusters of identical technological level with
a power law size distribution. When technological progress arises, the
spreading of technologies in the system can be described by extreme order
statistics.",2008-01-23,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.3672v1,Technology
The hybrid dilemma -- do hybrid technologies play a transitionary or stationary role in transitions processes?,Amir Mirzadeh Phirouzabadi,"This research unravels the stationary or transitionary dilemma of hybrid
technologies in transitions processes. A system dynamics technology interaction
framework is built and simulated based on Technological Innovation System and
Lotka-Volterra to investigate the inter-technology relationship impacts and
modes that hybrid technologies establish with incumbent and emerging
technologies. This is conducted for the case of conventional, hybrid and
battery electric vehicles under various scenarios . Results reveal that, by
acting as an exploration-hybrid solution, hybrid technologies maintain a
transitionary role by supporting mainly the technological development side of
emerging technology. On the contrary, by acting as an exploitation-hybrid
solution, they hardly (or never) sustain an inhibitive role against both the
technological and market development sides of incumbent technology. While
hybrid technologies may play a stationary role on the market development side
in transitions processes, simulation results show that maintaining all
inter-technology relationship modes as business-as-usual (i.e., baseline
scenario) but instead simultaneously strengthening the various socio-technical
dimensions of emerging technology and destabilising the various socio-technical
dimensions of incumbent technology (i.e., sociotechnical scenario) is a more
promising pathway in both short term (e.g., an accelerated uptake of emerging
technology and decline of incumbent technology) and long term (e.g., highest
emission reduction). Findings, additionally, reinforce the existence of both
spillover and try-harder versions of 'sailing-ship effect', which are either
seriously doubted in the literature or partially validated using raw
bibliometric and patents data.",2025-04-08,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06018v1,Technology
A Sociotechnical Readiness Level Framework for the Development of Advanced Nuclear Technologies,"Aditi Verma, Todd Allen","The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale was initially developed by NASA in
the 1970s and is now widely used in space, nuclear, and other complex
technology sectors in the US and beyond. The TRL scale is particularly useful
for determining where extrapolation of untested sub-systems or features could
produce technical risk, cause expensive redesigns, or act as a roadblock to
technology development. In this paper, we propose the development of a
sociotechnical readiness level (SRL), premised on the understanding that the
successful development and eventual use of a technology requires achieving not
only full technological readiness but also anticipating, prioritizing, and
addressing societal concerns that may arise during the course of development of
a technology. Failures to anticipate and address societal factors in the early
stages of technology development have led to high-profile delays and, in some
cases, ultimate failures of nuclear technology projects. The sociotechnical
readiness scale, which conceptually draws on the design research and science
and technology studies scholarship, centers on principles of equity and
environmental justice in technology design, and emphasizes the need for social
engagement during the process of technology development. Nowhere is such an
approach to technology development more vital or needed than for the long-term
management of spent nuclear fuel.",2024-03-27,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18204v1,Technology

"A new concept of technology with systemic-purposeful perpsective: theory, examples and empirical application",Mario Coccia,"Although definitions of technology exist to explain the patterns of
technological innovations, there is no general definition that explain the role
of technology for humans and other animal species in environment. The goal of
this study is to suggest a new concept of technology with a systemic-purposeful
perspective for technology analysis. Technology here is a complex system of
artifact, made and_or used by living systems, that is composed of more than one
entity or sub-system and a relationship that holds between each entity and at
least one other entity in the system, selected considering practical, technical
and_or economic characteristics to satisfy needs, achieve goals and_or solve
problems of users for purposes of adaptation and_or survival in environment.
Technology T changes current modes of cognition and action to enable makers
and_or users to take advantage of important opportunities or to cope with
consequential environmental threats. Technology, as a complex system, is formed
by different elements given by incremental and radical innovations.
Technological change generates the progress from a system T1 to T2, T3, etc.
driven by changes of technological trajectories and technological paradigms.
Several examples illustrate here these concepts and a simple model with a
preliminary empirical analysis shows how to operationalize the suggested
definition of technology. Overall, then, the role of adaptation (i.e.
reproductive advantage) can be explained as a main driver of technology use for
adopters to take advantage of important opportunities or to cope with
environmental threats. This study begins the process of clarifying and
generalizing, as far as possible, the concept of technology with a new
perspective that it can lay a foundation for the development of more
sophisticated concepts and theories to explain technological and economic
change in environment.",2019-09-11,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05689v1,Technology
Autonomous Mobile Clinics: Empowering Affordable Anywhere Anytime Healthcare Access,"Shaoshan Liu, Yuzhang Huang, Leiyu Shi","We are facing a global healthcare crisis today as the healthcare cost is ever

solves the healthcare access problem by bringing healthcare services to the
patient by the order of the patient's fingertips. Nevertheless, to enable a
universal autonomous mobile clinic network, a three-stage technical roadmap
needs to be achieved: In stage one, we focus on solving the inequity challenge
in the existing healthcare system by combining autonomous mobility and
telemedicine. In stage two, we develop an AI doctor for primary care, which we
foster from infancy to adulthood with clean healthcare data. With the AI
doctor, we can solve the inefficiency problem. In stage three, after we have
proven that the autonomous mobile clinic network can truly solve the target

Reliable and Resilient AI and IoT-based Personalised Healthcare Services: A Survey,"Najma Taimoor, Semeen Rehman","Recent technological and economic developments have transformed the
healthcare sector towards more personalized and IoT-based healthcare services.
These services are realized through control and monitoring applications that
are typically developed using artificial intelligence/machine learning-based
algorithms, which play a significant role in highlighting the efficiency of
traditional healthcare systems. Current personalized healthcare services are
dedicated to a specific environment to support technological personalization.
However, they are unable to consider different interrelated health conditions,
leading to inappropriate diagnoses and affecting sustainability and the
long-term health of patients. To this end, current Healthcare 5.0 technology
has evolved that supersede previous healthcare technologies. The goal of
healthcare 5.0 is to achieve an autonomous healthcare service, that takes into
account the interdependent effect of different health conditions of a patient.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on personalized healthcare services.
In particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of
comprehensive personalized healthcare services in modern healthcare Internet of
Things (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use
case scenario as a representative for modern HIoT. Second, we explored a
fundamental three-layer architecture for IoT-based healthcare systems using AI
and non-AI-based approaches, considering key requirements for CPHS followed by
their strengths and weaknesses in the frame of personalized healthcare
services. Third, we highlighted different security threats against each layer
of IoT architecture along with the possible AI and non-AI-based solutions.
Finally, we propose a methodology to develop reliable, resilient, and

existing approaches.",2022-08-29,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.05457v1,Healthcare
Security and Privacy for Healthcare Blockchains,"Rui Zhang, Rui Xue, Ling Liu","Healthcare blockchains provide an innovative way to store healthcare
information, execute healthcare transactions, and build trust for healthcare
data sharing and data integration in a decentralized open healthcare network
environment. Although the healthcare blockchain technology has attracted broad
interests and attention in industry, government and academia, the security and
privacy concerns remain the focus of debate when deploying blockchains for
information sharing in the healthcare sector from business operation to
research collaboration. This paper focuses on the security and privacy
requirements for medical data sharing using blockchain, and provides a
comprehensive analysis of the security and privacy risks and requirements,
accompanied by technical solution techniques and strategies. First, we discuss
the security and privacy requirements and attributes required for electronic
medical data sharing by deploying the healthcare blockchain. Second, we
categorize existing efforts into three reference blockchain usage scenarios for
electronic medical data sharing, and discuss the technologies for implementing
these security and privacy properties in the three categories of usage
scenarios for healthcare blockchain, such as anonymous signatures,
attribute-based encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, verification techniques for
smart contract security. Finally, we discuss other potential blockchain

Mathematical modeling for sustainability: How can it promote sustainable learning in mathematics education?,N. Karjanto,"This article reviews the current state of teaching and learning mathematical
modeling in the context of sustainable development goals for education at the
tertiary level. While ample research on mathematical modeling education and
published textbooks on the topic are available, there is a lack of focus on

by exploring the powerful intersection of mathematical modeling and
sustainability. Mathematical modeling for sustainability connects two distinct
realms: learning about the mathematics of sustainability and promoting
sustainable learning in mathematics education. The former involves teaching and
learning sustainability quantitatively, while the latter encompasses pedagogy
that enables learners to apply quantitative knowledge and skills to everyday
life and continue learning and improving mathematically beyond formal
education. To demonstrate the practical application of mathematical modeling
for sustainability, we discuss a specific textbook suitable for a pilot liberal
arts course. We illustrate how learners can grasp mathematical concepts related
to sustainability through simple yet mathematically diverse examples, which can
be further developed for teaching such a course. Indeed, by filling the gap in

of the existing indicators and complementing the various innovation assessment
toolkits, using large datasets from non-traditional sources. The success of
both top down implemented innovation districts and community-level innovation
ecosystems is complex and has not been well examined. Yet, limited data shed
light on the association between indicators and innovation performance at the

Electric power system security: the case for an integrated cyber-physical risk management framework,"Efthymios Karangelos, Louis Wehenkel","This paper concerns the security of the electric power transmission grid
facing the threat of malicious cyber-physical attackers. We posit that there is
no such thing as perfectly effective cyber-security. Rather, any cyber-security
measure comes with the possibility that a highly skilled attacker could
(eventually find a way to) bypass it. On these grounds, we formulate a
tri-level decision making problem seeking to co-optimize preventive physical
and cyber-security measures under uncertainty on the ability of an exogenous
cyber-physical attacker to overcome the latter. Preventive physical security
measures refer to the \emph{ex-ante} procurement of reserve capacity, which
translates into ramping restrictions in real-time. Cyber-security measures
refer to updating the firewall rules so as to impede an intruder from taking
over the cyber infrastructure of the grid and disconnecting power generators
and transmission branches. We adopt standard assumptions to formalize the inner
optimization problems corresponding to the cyber-physical attacker and power
grid operator and focus on uncertainty management at the uppermost level of the
problem. Our findings establish that physical- and cyber-security measures are
non-exchangeable complements in keeping the power grid operation secure.",2025-02-27,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20287v1,Cyber Security
Towards Automated Cyber Range Design: Characterizing and Matching Demands to Supplies,"Ekzhin Ear, Jose L. C. Remy, Shouhuai Xu","Cyber ranges mimic real-world cyber environments and are in high demand.
Before building their own cyber ranges, organizations need to deeply understand
what construction supplies are available to them. A fundamental supply is the
cyber range architecture, which prompts an important research question: Which
cyber range architecture is most appropriate for an organization's
requirements? To answer this question, we propose an innovative framework to
specify cyber range requirements, characterize cyber range architectures (based
on our analysis of 45 cyber range architectures), and match cyber range
architectures to cyber range requirements.",2023-07-10,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04416v1,Cyber Security

Introduction of a Hybrid Monitor to Cyber-Physical Systems,"J Ceasar Aguma, Bruce McMillin, Amelia Regan","Computing and technology have vastly changed since the introduction of
firewall technology in 1988. The internet has grown from a simple network of
networks to a cyber and physical entity that encompasses the entire planet.
Cyber-physical systems(CPS) now control most of the day to day operations of
human civilization from autonomous cars to nuclear energy plants. While
phenomenal, this growth spurt has created new security threats. These are
threats that cannot be blocked by a firewall for they are not only cyber but
cyber-physical. In light of these new cyber-physical threats, this text
proposes a security measure that promises to enhance the security of
cyber-physical systems. Using theoretical cyber, physical, and cyber-physical
attack scenarios, this text will highlight the need for some sort of monitor in
cyber-physical systems as an extra security measure. Additionally, this text
will illustrate the efficiency of said monitor using a Shannon entropy proof,

CPES-QSM: A Quantitative Method Towards the Secure Operation of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems,"Juan Ospina, Venkatesh Venkataramanan, Charalambos Konstantinou","Power systems are evolving into cyber-physical energy systems (CPES) due to
the integration of modern communication and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.
CPES security evaluation is challenging since the physical and cyber layers are
often not considered holistically. Existing literature focuses on only
optimizing the operation of either the physical or cyber layer while ignoring
the interactions between them. This paper proposes a metric, the Cyber-Physical
Energy System Quantitative Security Metric (CPES-QSM), that quantifies the
interaction between the cyber and physical layers across three domains:
electrical, cyber-risk, and network topology. A method for incorporating the
proposed cyber-metric into operational decisions is also proposed by
formulating a cyber-constrained AC optimal power flow (C-ACOPF) that considers
the status of all the CPES layers. The cyber-constrained ACOPF considers the
vulnerabilities of physical and cyber networks by incorporating factors such as
voltage stability, contingencies, graph-theory, and IoT cyber risks, while
using a multi-criteria decision-making technique. Simulation studies are
conducted using standard IEEE test systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed metric and the C-ACOPF formulation.",2022-06-07,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03543v2,Cyber Security
Digital Adoption and Cyber Security: An Analysis of Canadian Businesses,"Joann Jasiak, Peter MacKenzie, Purevdorj Tuvaandorj","This paper examines how Canadian firms balance the benefits of technology
adoption against the rising risk of cyber security breaches. We merge data from
the 2021 Canadian Survey of Digital Technology and Internet Use and the 2021
Canadian Survey of Cyber Security and Cybercrime to investigate the trade-off
firms face when adopting digital technologies to enhance productivity and
efficiency, balanced against the potential increase in cyber security risk. The
analysis explores the extent of digital technology adoption, differences across
industries, the subsequent impacts on efficiency, and associated cyber security
vulnerabilities. We build aggregate variables, such as the Business Digital
Usage Score and a cyber security incidence variable to quantify each firm's
digital engagement and cyber security risk. A survey-weight-adjusted Lasso
estimator is employed, and a debiasing method for high-dimensional logit models
is introduced to identify the drivers of technological efficiency and cyber
risk. The analysis reveals a digital divide linked to firm size, industry, and
workforce composition. While rapid expansion of tools such as cloud services or
artificial intelligence can raise efficiency, it simultaneously heightens
exposure to cyber threats, particularly among larger enterprises.",2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12413v1,Cyber Security

Robot Accident Investigation: a case study in Responsible Robotics,"Alan F. T. Winfield, Katie Winkle, Helena Webb, Ulrik Lyngs, Marina Jirotka, Carl Macrae","Robot accidents are inevitable. Although rare, they have been happening since
assembly-line robots were first introduced in the 1960s. But a new generation
of social robots are now becoming commonplace. Often with sophisticated
embedded artificial intelligence (AI) social robots might be deployed as care
robots to assist elderly or disabled people to live independently. Smart robot
toys offer a compelling interactive play experience for children and
increasingly capable autonomous vehicles (AVs) the promise of hands-free
personal transport and fully autonomous taxis. Unlike industrial robots which
are deployed in safety cages, social robots are designed to operate in human
environments and interact closely with humans; the likelihood of robot
accidents is therefore much greater for social robots than industrial robots.
This paper sets out a draft framework for social robot accident investigation;
a framework which proposes both the technology and processes that would allow
social robot accidents to be investigated with no less rigour than we expect of
air or rail accident investigations. The paper also places accident
investigation within the practice of responsible robotics, and makes the case
that social robotics without accident investigation would be no less

Pattern Formation for Asynchronous Robots without Agreement in Chirality,"Sruti Gan Chaudhuri, Swapnil Ghike, Shrainik Jain, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyaya","This paper presents a deterministic algorithm for forming a given asymmetric
pattern in finite time by a set of autonomous, homogeneous, oblivious mobile
robots under the CORDA model. The robots are represented as points on the 2D
plane. There is no explicit communication between the robots. The robots
coordinate among themselves by observing the positions of the other robots on
the plane. Initially all the robots are assumed to be stationary. The robots
have local coordinate systems defined by Sense of Direction (SoD), orientation

We show that these robots can form any given asymmetric pattern in finite time.",2014-03-11,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.2625v1,Robotics
Formation of General Position by Asynchronous Mobile Robots,"S. Bhagat, S. Gan Chaudhuri, K. Mukhopadhyaya","The traditional distributed model of autonomous, homogeneous, mobile point
robots usually assumes that the robots do not create any visual obstruction for
the other robots, i.e., the robots are see through. In this paper, we consider
a slightly more realistic model, by incorporating the notion of obstructed
visibility (i.e., robots are not see through) for other robots. Under the new
model of visibility, a robot may not have the full view of its surroundings.
Many of the existing algorithms demand that each robot should have the complete
knowledge of the positions of other robots. Since, vision is the only mean of
their communication, it is required that the robots are in general position
(i.e., no three robots are collinear). We consider asynchronous robots. They
also do not have common chirality (or any agreement on a global coordinate
system). In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for obtaining a
general position for the robots in finite time from any arbitrary
configuration. The algorithm also assures collision free motion for each robot.
This algorithm may also be used as a preprocessing module for many other
subsequent tasks performed by the robots.",2014-08-09,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.2072v1,Robotics
A review of cuspidal serial and parallel manipulators,"Philippe Wenger, Damien Chablat","Cuspidal robots can move from one inverse or direct kinematic solution to
another without ever passing through a singularity. These robots have remained
unknown because almost all industrial robots do not have this feature. However,
in fact, industrial robots are the exceptions. Some robots appeared recently in
the industrial market can be shown to be cuspidal but, surprisingly, almost
nobody knows it and robot users meet difficulties in planning trajectories with
these robots. This paper proposes a review on the fundamental and application
aspects of cuspidal robots. It addresses the important issues raised by these
robots for the design and planning of trajectories. The identification of all
cuspidal robots is still an open issue. This paper recalls in details the case
of serial robots with three joints but it also addresses robots with more
complex architectures such as 6-revolute-jointed robot and parallel robots. We
hope that this paper will help disseminate more widely knowledge on cuspidal

Optimal Dispersion of Silent Robots in a Ring,"Bibhuti Das, Barun Gorain, Kaushik Mondal, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyaya, Supantha Pandit","Given a set of co-located mobile robots in an unknown anonymous graph, the
robots must relocate themselves in distinct graph nodes to solve the dispersion
problem. In this paper, we consider the dispersion problem for silent robots
\cite{gorain2024collaborative}, i.e., no direct, explicit communication between
any two robots placed in the nodes of an oriented $n$ node ring network. The
robots operate in synchronous rounds. The dispersion problem for silent mobile
robots has been studied in arbitrary graphs where the robots start from a
single source. In this paper, we focus on the dispersion problem for silent
mobile robots where robots can start from multiple sources. The robots have
unique labels from a range $[0,\;L]$ for some positive integer $L$. Any two
co-located robots do not have the information about the label of the other
robot. The robots have weak multiplicity detection capability, which means they
can determine if it is alone on a node. The robots are assumed to be able to
identify an increase or decrease in the number of robots present on a node in a
particular round. However, the robots can not get the exact number of increase
or decrease in the number of robots. We have proposed a deterministic
distributed algorithm that solves the dispersion of $k$ robots in an oriented
ring in $O(\log L+k)$ synchronous rounds with $O(\log L)$ bits of memory for
each robot. A lower bound $\Omega(\log L+k)$ on time for the dispersion of $k$
robots on a ring network is presented to establish the optimality of the
proposed algorithm.",2024-08-10,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05491v1,Robotics
Artificial Intelligence and Systems Theory: Applied to Cooperative Robots,"Pedro U. Lima, Luis M. M. Custodio","This paper describes an approach to the design of a population of cooperative

Game-Theoretic Modeling of Human Adaptation in Human-Robot Collaboration,"Stefanos Nikolaidis, Swaprava Nath, Ariel D. Procaccia, Siddhartha Srinivasa","In human-robot teams, humans often start with an inaccurate model of the
robot capabilities. As they interact with the robot, they infer the robot's
capabilities and partially adapt to the robot, i.e., they might change their
actions based on the observed outcomes and the robot's actions, without
replicating the robot's policy. We present a game-theoretic model of human
partial adaptation to the robot, where the human responds to the robot's
actions by maximizing a reward function that changes stochastically over time,
capturing the evolution of their expectations of the robot's capabilities. The
robot can then use this model to decide optimally between taking actions that
reveal its capabilities to the human and taking the best action given the
information that the human currently has. We prove that under certain
observability assumptions, the optimal policy can be computed efficiently. We
demonstrate through a human subject experiment that the proposed model
significantly improves human-robot team performance, compared to policies that
assume complete adaptation of the human to the robot.",2017-01-26,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07790v2,Robotics
Vulnerability of Finitely-long Blockchains in Securing Data,"Yiming Jiang, Jiangfan Zhang","Recently, blockchain has been applied in various fields to secure data
exchanges and storage in decentralized systems. In a blockchain application
where the task of the application which makes use of the data stored in a
blockchain has to be accomplished by a time instant, the employed blockchain is
essentially finitely-long. In this paper, we consider a general finitely-long
blockchain model which is generalized from most existing works on finitely-long
blockchain applications, and take the first step towards characterizing the
vulnerability of finitely-long blockchains in securing data against
double-spending attacks. For the first time, we develop a general closed-form
expression for the probability of success in launching a double-spending attack
on a finitely-long blockchain. This probability essentially characterizes the
vulnerability of finitely-long blockchains. Then, we prove that the probability
of success in launching a double-spending attack on a finitely-long blockchain
is no greater than that on an infinitely-long blockchain, which implies that
finitely-long blockchains are less vulnerable to double-spending attacks than
infinitely-long blockchains. Moreover, we show that unlike infinitely-long
blockchains which can be surely paralyzed by a 51% attack, finitely-long
blockchains are more resistant to 51% attacks.",2023-04-19,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09965v1,Blockchain
A Framework for Blockchain Interoperability and Runtime Selection,"Philipp Frauenthaler, Michael Borkowski, Stefan Schulte","The suitability of a particular blockchain for a given use case depends
mainly on the blockchain's functional and non-functional properties. Such
properties may vary over time, and thus, a selected blockchain may become
unsuitable for a given use case. This uncertainty may hinder the widespread
adoption of blockchain technologies in general. To mitigate the impact of
volatile blockchain properties, we propose a framework that monitors several
blockchains, allows the user to define functional and non-functional
requirements, determines the most appropriate blockchain, and enables the
switchover to that chain at runtime. Our evaluation using a reference
implementation shows that switching to another blockchain can save cost and
enable users to benefit from better performance and a higher level of trust.",2019-05-15,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07014v1,Blockchain
Testimonium: A Cost-Efficient Blockchain Relay,"Philipp Frauenthaler, Marten Sigwart, Christof Spanring, Stefan Schulte","Current blockchain technologies provide very limited means of
interoperability. In particular, solutions enabling blockchains to verify the
existence of data on other blockchains are either very costly or are not fully
decentralized. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Testimonium, a novel
blockchain relay scheme that applies a validation-on-demand pattern and the
on-chain execution of Simplified Payment Verifications to enable the
verification of data across blockchains while remaining fully decentralized.
Evaluating the scheme for Ethereum-based blockchains shows that Testimonium
achieves a cost reduction of up to 92% over existing solutions. As such, the
scheme lays a strong foundation for generic blockchain interoperability. For

Selecting Reliable Blockchain Peers via Hybrid Blockchain Reliability Prediction,"Peilin Zheng, Zibin Zheng, Liang Chen","Blockchain and blockchain-based decentralized applications are attracting
increasing attentions recently. In public blockchain systems, users usually
connect to third-party peers or run a peer to join the P2P blockchain network.
However, connecting to unreliable blockchain peers will make users waste

select the reliable blockchain peers, it is urgently needed to evaluate and
predict the reliability of them. Faced with this problem, we propose H-BRP,
Hybrid Blockchain Reliability Prediction model to extract the blockchain
reliability factors then make personalized prediction for each user.
Large-scale real-world experiments are conducted on 100 blockchain requesters

Quantum Computation and Quantum Information,Yazhen Wang,"Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in
computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will

stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum
computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum
algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo
techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum
computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to
revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be
generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine
random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up
median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This
paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and

Optimal Stochastic Resource Allocation for Distributed Quantum Computing,"Napat Ngoenriang, Minrui Xu, Sucha Supittayapornpong, Dusit Niyato, Han Yu, Xuemin, Shen","With the advent of interconnected quantum computers, i.e., distributed
quantum computing (DQC), multiple quantum computers can now collaborate via
quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However, DQC
faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or
duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics,
quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks.
However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum
computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and
properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In this
paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on stochastic
programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum resources.
Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to handle
the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing power, and fidelity in

Behind the Deepfake: 8% Create; 90% Concerned. Surveying public exposure to and perceptions of deepfakes in the UK,"Tvesha Sippy, Florence Enock, Jonathan Bright, Helen Z. Margetts","This article examines public exposure to and perceptions of deepfakes based
on insights from a nationally representative survey of 1403 UK adults. The
survey is one of the first of its kind since recent improvements in deepfake
technology and widespread adoption of political deepfakes. The findings reveal
three key insights. First, on average, 15% of people report exposure to harmful
deepfakes, including deepfake pornography, deepfake frauds/scams and other
potentially harmful deepfakes such as those that spread health/religious
misinformation/propaganda. In terms of common targets, exposure to deepfakes
featuring celebrities was 50.2%, whereas those featuring politicians was 34.1%.
And 5.7% of respondents recall exposure to a selection of high profile
political deepfakes in the UK. Second, while exposure to harmful deepfakes was
relatively low, awareness of and fears about deepfakes were high (and women
were significantly more likely to report experiencing such fears than men). As
with fears, general concerns about the spread of deepfakes were also high;
90.4% of the respondents were either very concerned or somewhat concerned about
this issue. Most respondents (at least 91.8%) were concerned that deepfakes
could add to online child sexual abuse material, increase distrust in
information and manipulate public opinion. Third, while awareness about
deepfakes was high, usage of deepfake tools was relatively low (8%). Most
respondents were not confident about their detection abilities and were
trustful of audiovisual content online. Our work highlights how the problem of
deepfakes has become embedded in public consciousness in just a few years; it
also highlights the need for media literacy programmes and other policy
interventions to address the spread of harmful deepfakes.",2024-07-08,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05529v1,deepfakes
WildDeepfake: A Challenging Real-World Dataset for Deepfake Detection,"Bojia Zi, Minghao Chang, Jingjing Chen, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang","In recent years, the abuse of a face swap technique called deepfake has
raised enormous public concerns. So far, a large number of deepfake videos
(known as ""deepfakes"") have been crafted and uploaded to the internet, calling
for effective countermeasures. One promising countermeasure against deepfakes
is deepfake detection. Several deepfake datasets have been released to support
the training and testing of deepfake detectors, such as DeepfakeDetection and
FaceForensics++. While this has greatly advanced deepfake detection, most of
the real videos in these datasets are filmed with a few volunteer actors in
limited scenes, and the fake videos are crafted by researchers using a few
popular deepfake softwares. Detectors developed on these datasets may become
less effective against real-world deepfakes on the internet. To better support
detection against real-world deepfakes, in this paper, we introduce a new
dataset WildDeepfake which consists of 7,314 face sequences extracted from 707
deepfake videos collected completely from the internet. WildDeepfake is a small
dataset that can be used, in addition to existing datasets, to develop and test
the effectiveness of deepfake detectors against real-world deepfakes. We
conduct a systematic evaluation of a set of baseline detection networks on both
existing and our WildDeepfake datasets, and show that WildDeepfake is indeed a
more challenging dataset, where the detection performance can decrease
drastically. We also propose two (eg. 2D and 3D) Attention-based Deepfake
Detection Networks (ADDNets) to leverage the attention masks on real/fake faces
for improved detection. We empirically verify the effectiveness of ADDNets on
both existing datasets and WildDeepfake. The dataset is available at:

Linguistic Profiling of Deepfakes: An Open Database for Next-Generation Deepfake Detection,"Yabin Wang, Zhiwu Huang, Zhiheng Ma, Xiaopeng Hong","The emergence of text-to-image generative models has revolutionized the field
of deepfakes, enabling the creation of realistic and convincing visual content
directly from textual descriptions. However, this advancement presents
considerably greater challenges in detecting the authenticity of such content.
Existing deepfake detection datasets and methods often fall short in
effectively capturing the extensive range of emerging deepfakes and offering
satisfactory explanatory information for detection. To address the significant
issue, this paper introduces a deepfake database (DFLIP-3K) for the development
of convincing and explainable deepfake detection. It encompasses about 300K
diverse deepfake samples from approximately 3K generative models, which boasts
the largest number of deepfake models in the literature. Moreover, it collects
around 190K linguistic footprints of these deepfakes. The two distinguished
features enable DFLIP-3K to develop a benchmark that promotes progress in
linguistic profiling of deepfakes, which includes three sub-tasks namely
deepfake detection, model identification, and prompt prediction. The deepfake
model and prompt are two essential components of each deepfake, and thus
dissecting them linguistically allows for an invaluable exploration of
trustworthy and interpretable evidence in deepfake detection, which we believe
is the key for the next-generation deepfake detection. Furthermore, DFLIP-3K is
envisioned as an open database that fosters transparency and encourages
collaborative efforts to further enhance its growth. Our extensive experiments
on the developed benchmark verify that our DFLIP-3K database is capable of
serving as a standardized resource for evaluating and comparing
linguistic-based deepfake detection, identification, and prompt prediction
techniques.",2024-01-04,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02335v1,deepfakes
Deepfake-Eval-2024: A Multi-Modal In-the-Wild Benchmark of Deepfakes Circulated in 2024,"Nuria Alina Chandra, Ryan Murtfeldt, Lin Qiu, Arnab Karmakar, Hannah Lee, Emmanuel Tanumihardja, Kevin Farhat, Ben Caffee, Sejin Paik, Changyeon Lee, Jongwook Choi, Aerin Kim, Oren Etzioni","In the age of increasingly realistic generative AI, robust deepfake detection
is essential for mitigating fraud and disinformation. While many deepfake
detectors report high accuracy on academic datasets, we show that these
academic benchmarks are out of date and not representative of real-world
deepfakes. We introduce Deepfake-Eval-2024, a new deepfake detection benchmark
consisting of in-the-wild deepfakes collected from social media and deepfake
detection platform users in 2024. Deepfake-Eval-2024 consists of 45 hours of
videos, 56.5 hours of audio, and 1,975 images, encompassing the latest
manipulation technologies. The benchmark contains diverse media content from 88
different websites in 52 different languages. We find that the performance of
open-source state-of-the-art deepfake detection models drops precipitously when
evaluated on Deepfake-Eval-2024, with AUC decreasing by 50% for video, 48% for
audio, and 45% for image models compared to previous benchmarks. We also
evaluate commercial deepfake detection models and models finetuned on
Deepfake-Eval-2024, and find that they have superior performance to
off-the-shelf open-source models, but do not yet reach the accuracy of deepfake

DeePhy: On Deepfake Phylogeny,"Kartik Narayan, Harsh Agarwal, Kartik Thakral, Surbhi Mittal, Mayank Vatsa, Richa Singh","Deepfake refers to tailored and synthetically generated videos which are now
prevalent and spreading on a large scale, threatening the trustworthiness of
the information available online. While existing datasets contain different
kinds of deepfakes which vary in their generation technique, they do not
consider progression of deepfakes in a ""phylogenetic"" manner. It is possible
that an existing deepfake face is swapped with another face. This process of
face swapping can be performed multiple times and the resultant deepfake can be
evolved to confuse the deepfake detection algorithms. Further, many databases
do not provide the employed generative model as target labels. Model
attribution helps in enhancing the explainability of the detection results by
providing information on the generative model employed. In order to enable the
research community to address these questions, this paper proposes DeePhy, a
novel Deepfake Phylogeny dataset which consists of 5040 deepfake videos
generated using three different generation techniques. There are 840 videos of
one-time swapped deepfakes, 2520 videos of two-times swapped deepfakes and 1680
videos of three-times swapped deepfakes. With over 30 GBs in size, the database
is prepared in over 1100 hours using 18 GPUs of 1,352 GB cumulative memory. We
also present the benchmark on DeePhy dataset using six deepfake detection
algorithms. The results highlight the need to evolve the research of model
attribution of deepfakes and generalize the process over a variety of deepfake
generation techniques. The database is available at:

Robust Sequential DeepFake Detection,"Rui Shao, Tianxing Wu, Ziwei Liu","Since photorealistic faces can be readily generated by facial manipulation
technologies nowadays, potential malicious abuse of these technologies has
drawn great concerns. Numerous deepfake detection methods are thus proposed.
However, existing methods only focus on detecting one-step facial manipulation.
As the emergence of easy-accessible facial editing applications, people can
easily manipulate facial components using multi-step operations in a sequential
manner. This new threat requires us to detect a sequence of facial
manipulations, which is vital for both detecting deepfake media and recovering
original faces afterwards. Motivated by this observation, we emphasize the need
and propose a novel research problem called Detecting Sequential DeepFake
Manipulation (Seq-DeepFake). Unlike the existing deepfake detection task only
demanding a binary label prediction, detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation
requires correctly predicting a sequential vector of facial manipulation
operations. To support a large-scale investigation, we construct the first
Seq-DeepFake dataset, where face images are manipulated sequentially with
corresponding annotations of sequential facial manipulation vectors. Based on
this new dataset, we cast detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation as a specific
image-to-sequence task and propose a concise yet effective Seq-DeepFake
Transformer (SeqFakeFormer). To better reflect real-world deepfake data
distributions, we further apply various perturbations on the original
Seq-DeepFake dataset and construct the more challenging Sequential DeepFake
dataset with perturbations (Seq-DeepFake-P). To exploit deeper correlation
between images and sequences when facing Seq-DeepFake-P, a dedicated
Seq-DeepFake Transformer with Image-Sequence Reasoning (SeqFakeFormer++) is
devised, which builds stronger correspondence between image-sequence pairs for
more robust Seq-DeepFake detection.",2023-09-26,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14991v2,deepfakes
Are Deepfakes Concerning? Analyzing Conversations of Deepfakes on Reddit and Exploring Societal Implications,"Dilrukshi Gamage, Piyush Ghasiya, Vamshi Krishna Bonagiri, Mark E Whiting, Kazutoshi Sasahara","Deepfakes are synthetic content generated using advanced deep learning and AI
technologies. The advancement of technology has created opportunities for
anyone to create and share deepfakes much easier. This may lead to societal
concerns based on how communities engage with it. However, there is limited
research available to understand how communities perceive deepfakes. We
examined deepfake conversations on Reddit from 2018 to 2021 -- including major
topics and their temporal changes as well as implications of these
conversations. Using a mixed-method approach -- topic modeling and qualitative
coding, we found 6,638 posts and 86,425 comments discussing concerns of the
believable nature of deepfakes and how platforms moderate them. We also found
Reddit conversations to be pro-deepfake and building a community that supports
creating and sharing deepfake artifacts and building a marketplace regardless
of the consequences. Possible implications derived from qualitative codes
indicate that deepfake conversations raise societal concerns. We propose that
there are implications for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to mitigate the
harm created from deepfakes.",2022-03-14,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15044v1,deepfakes
Combatting deepfakes: Policies to address national security threats and rights violations,"Andrea Miotti, Akash Wasil","This paper provides policy recommendations to address threats from deepfakes.
First, we provide background information about deepfakes and review the harms
they pose. We describe how deepfakes are currently used to proliferate sexual
abuse material, commit fraud, manipulate voter behavior, and pose threats to
national security. Second, we review previous legislative proposals designed to
address deepfakes. Third, we present a comprehensive policy proposal that
focuses on addressing multiple parts of the deepfake supply chain. The deepfake
supply chain begins with a small number of model developers, model providers,
and compute providers, and it expands to include billions of potential deepfake
creators. We describe this supply chain in greater detail and describe how
entities at each step of the supply chain ought to take reasonable measures to
prevent the creation and proliferation of deepfakes. Finally, we address
potential counterpoints of our proposal. Overall, deepfakes will present
increasingly severe threats to global security and individual liberties. To
address these threats, we call on policymakers to enact legislation that
addresses multiple parts of the deepfake supply chain.",2024-02-14,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09581v2,deepfakes
GBDF: Gender Balanced DeepFake Dataset Towards Fair DeepFake Detection,"Aakash Varma Nadimpalli, Ajita Rattani","Facial forgery by deepfakes has raised severe societal concerns. Several
solutions have been proposed by the vision community to effectively combat the
misinformation on the internet via automated deepfake detection systems. Recent
studies have demonstrated that facial analysis-based deep learning models can
discriminate based on protected attributes. For the commercial adoption and
massive roll-out of the deepfake detection technology, it is vital to evaluate
and understand the fairness (the absence of any prejudice or favoritism) of
deepfake detectors across demographic variations such as gender and race. As
the performance differential of deepfake detectors between demographic
subgroups would impact millions of people of the deprived sub-group. This paper
aims to evaluate the fairness of the deepfake detectors across males and
females. However, existing deepfake datasets are not annotated with demographic
labels to facilitate fairness analysis. To this aim, we manually annotated
existing popular deepfake datasets with gender labels and evaluated the
performance differential of current deepfake detectors across gender. Our
analysis on the gender-labeled version of the datasets suggests (a) current
deepfake datasets have skewed distribution across gender, and (b) commonly
adopted deepfake detectors obtain unequal performance across gender with mostly
males outperforming females. Finally, we contributed a gender-balanced and
annotated deepfake dataset, GBDF, to mitigate the performance differential and
to promote research and development towards fairness-aware deep fake detectors.

DeepFake-Adapter: Dual-Level Adapter for DeepFake Detection,"Rui Shao, Tianxing Wu, Liqiang Nie, Ziwei Liu","Existing deepfake detection methods fail to generalize well to unseen or
degraded samples, which can be attributed to the over-fitting of low-level
forgery patterns. Here we argue that high-level semantics are also
indispensable recipes for generalizable forgery detection. Recently, large
pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown promising generalization
capability. In this paper, we propose the first parameter-efficient tuning
approach for deepfake detection, namely DeepFake-Adapter, to effectively and
efficiently adapt the generalizable high-level semantics from large pre-trained
ViTs to aid deepfake detection. Given large pre-trained models but limited
deepfake data, DeepFake-Adapter introduces lightweight yet dedicated dual-level
adapter modules to a ViT while keeping the model backbone frozen. Specifically,
to guide the adaptation process to be aware of both global and local forgery
cues of deepfake data, 1) we not only insert Globally-aware Bottleneck Adapters
in parallel to MLP layers of ViT, 2) but also actively cross-attend
Locally-aware Spatial Adapters with features from ViT. Unlike existing deepfake
detection methods merely focusing on low-level forgery patterns, the forgery
detection process of our model can be regularized by generalizable high-level
semantics from a pre-trained ViT and adapted by global and local low-level
forgeries of deepfake data. Extensive experiments on several standard deepfake
detection benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably,
DeepFake-Adapter demonstrates a convincing advantage under cross-dataset and
cross-manipulation settings. The code has been released at
